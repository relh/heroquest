## Storyline

In **HeroQuest**, you play as a warrior who has just arrived at an unnamed village. With nowhere to stay, a kind knight takes you in for the night—only to decide overnight that he will train you in the ways of the paladin! He gradually teaches you how to fight and survive in the dangerous lands surrounding the village. As you gain experience in combat, he instructs you in the use of spells and shows you how to access new areas full of perilous creatures. Once you become powerful enough, he sends you on an epic quest to slay a creature so formidable, only the greatest hero can vanquish it…

## Instructions

### Playing the Game

The user interface of **HeroQuest** is intuitive and easy to navigate. Players simply read the options and press the corresponding key to perform an action.

For example, you might see:

1. Attack
2. Pass
3. Flee
4. Cast a Spell
5. Use an Item

By inputting the number for your choice, the corresponding action will occur.

### Battling

Battles in **HeroQuest** are turn-based. During your turn, you have the following options:

- **Attack:**
  The primary method for dealing damage to enemies. Use this option most of the time.

- **Pass:**
  Use this only when every other option would result in a negative consequence, or if you are intentionally trying to forfeit your turn.

- **Flee:**
  Attempt to run away from the enemy. There is a 50% success rate, so be cautious when using this option if you are low on health.

- **Cast a Spell:**
  Use spells to heal, stun, damage enemies, or shield yourself. This is a versatile option and is used almost as much as attacking.

- **Use an Item:**
  Currently, the only combat-usable items are potions. There are two types:
    - Healing potions (restore health)
    - Mana potions (restore mana)

At the end of each turn, you regain an amount of mana that depends on your character’s spirit.

> **Note:** Death in **HeroQuest** is not permanent. When you die, you lose half your gold and are resurrected by your knight trainer.

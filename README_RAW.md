Storyline


	In HeroQuest, you play the role of a warrior who has just arrived at an unnamed village. Seeing, that you have no place to stay, a kind knight takes you in for the night… Overnight, he decides that he will train you in the ways of the paladin! He gradually teaches you how to fight and how to survive in the dangerous lands around the village. As you gain experience fighting, he teaches you how to use spells, and tells you how to get to new areas full of dangerous creatures. After he decides that you are powerful enough, he sends you off on an epic quest to slay a creature so powerful, only the greatest hero could do it…
Instructions


Playing the Game

	The user interface of HeroQuest is intuitive and easy for the user to maneuver. All that a player has to do to play the game is read and press the keys that allow them to do actions.
For example, a player might see:
1. Attack
2. Pass
3. Flee
4. Cast a spell
5. Use an item

All the the player has to do is enter the number that corresponds to the action that they wish to do. By inputting “1”, they will attack, by inputting “2” they will pass, and so on.
Battling
	Battles in HeroQuest are turn based, and on your turn, you have the 5 options that you saw on the previous page. (Attack, Pass, Flee, Cast a spell, Use an item)
Attacking – Attacking is the easiest way of doing damage to your enemy. This is the option that you will select most of the time
Passing – Passing should almost never be selected. Passing gives up your turn and should only be done if doing any other option would be worse or if you are trying to die.
Fleeing – This option allows you to try to run away from your enemy. It has a 50% success rate, so if you are low on health and are trying to run, you may fail and die anyway. Fleeing is not foolproof.
Casting a Spell – A good player will use this option almost as much as attack. Spells do a variety of helpful things in combat, including healing yourself, stunning your enemy, doing damage to your enemy, and shielding yourself.
Using an Item – The only combat-usable items in HeroQuest are potions. The two types of potions are healing potions and mana potions. Healing potions restore your health and mana potions restore your mana. Use healing potions when low on health, and use mana potions when low on mana.

At the end of each of your turns, you will regain an amount of mana, which depends on how much spirit your character has.

*Death in HeroQuest is not permanent! Upon death, you will lose half your gold and then be resurrected back to life by your knight trainer!

Character Information
	All the information that you will need to know about your character is displayed in the left window. This information includes your character’s stats, (level, strength, stamina, intellect, spirit, hp, mana) location, effects, equipment, attack, armor, spells, experience, and gold.

Stats:
Strength – This stat increases the amount of damage that you do. Your attack damage increases by 1 for every 2 strength that you have.
Stamina – This stat increases the amount of maximum hitpoints, or hp, that you have. This is the most important stat, because without a lot of hp, you will die after taking only a few hits! Each point of Stamina increases your maximum hp by 2.
Intellect – This stat increases the amount of maximum mana that you have. This is also an important stat, because without enough mana, you will not be able to cast you most powerful spells! Each point of Intellect increases your maximum mana by 3
Spirit – This stat increases the amount of mana that you regain at the end of your turns in battle. Every 5 spirit restores 1 mana point at the end of your turns.

Location: This shows where your character currently is.
Effects: This shows positive and negative effects that are currently on your character. Good effects are displayed in green, and bad effects are displayed in red.
Equipment: Shows the weapon that you are currently equipped with and the shield that you are currently equipped with.
Attack: This gives you a range of your weakest possible attack to your strongest possible attack. This range is affected by your strength, your weapon, and by effects currently on your character. The range does not account for your enemy’s armor, so expect your actual attack to be lower than your attack range because of your enemy’s armor.
Armor: Armor in HeroQuest is not physical armor, such as a suit of armor, but how much damage will be reduced from an enemy’s attack. Your armor rating is affected by your shield, and by effects currently on your character.
Spells: This displays all of the spells that you’re character currently knows. You can go to your knight trainer to find out what your spells cost and do.
Experience: You gain exp from fighting creatures. After acquiring enough experience, or exp, you will gain a level. Upon gaining a level, you gain 15 talent points which you must immediately spend on increasing your character’s stats.
Gold: You gain gold from fighting creatures and from adventuring in areas. You can spend gold to buy items.
Inventory
	Your character’s inventory is all of the items that it is currently carrying. Your inventory is split into 5 sections. (weapons, shields, food, drinks, potions)
Weapons: While in this part of your inventory, you can equip different weapons that you have acquired. Different weapons have different attack values.
Shields: While in this part of your inventory, you can equip different shields that you have acquired. Different shields have different armor values.
Food: While in this part of your inventory, you can eat food, which restores your health. Different foods restore different amounts of health. Foods can only be eaten while out of combat. (Not in battle)
Drink: While in this part of your inventory, you can drink drinks, which restore your mana. Different drinks restore different amounts of mana. Drinks can only be drunk while out of combat. (Not in battle)
Potions: While in this part of your inventory, you can consume potions, which either restore your health or your mana, depending on the type of potion. Different potions restore different amounts of health and mana. Potions can be used in and out of combat.
Places
	There are many places in HeroQuest to go to. Only some are listed here, and you will have to level up your character to unlock new places.
Knight’s House – This is where you can go to find out what your spells currently do and cost. As your gain levels, the cost and effects of your spells change! Also, you can go here to learn new places and learn how to get to new areas after you have grown a level!
Weapons/Shields Store – This is where you can go to buy weapons and shields. These are expensive, but are necessary upgrades if you want to keep up with the difficulty of the creatures in new areas!
Food/Drinks Store – This is where you can go to buy food and drinks, which restore your health and mana out of combat. Food and drink is necessary to get back your hp and mana after battles.
Potions Store – This is where you can go to buy potions, which are expensive, but are very helpful in giving you an edge over your enemy in combat.
The Outskirts of Town – This is the place which leads to every other place! Nothing can be done here, but every place can be reached from here! You can go back to the village from here, or go to a dangerous to train and gain exp. The first dangerous area that you will go to is the Great Plains. More will become available after you speak to your knight trainer after leveling.
